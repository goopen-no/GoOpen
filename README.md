## Open standards
Open standards as a concept is one of the most important cornerstones of the Internet. Standards are key to allowing devices, services, and applications to work together across a wide and dispersed network of networks. In addition to the standards themselves, the open processes and principles on which they are developed ensure the evolution of Internet technologies that meet the need of the growing number of devices and uses that empower people around the world.
